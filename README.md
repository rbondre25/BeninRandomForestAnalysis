**Summary:** Mosquitoes are vectors for serious diseases, including Dengue, West Nile Virus, Yellow Fever, and Zika. Mosquito vector-borne diseases pose significant global health risks for millions of people. Considering the severity of mosquito-borne diseases, forecasting mosquito abundance can aid in limiting the spread of mosquito vector-borne disease and managing disease threats. This study proposes the implementation of random forest machine learning models to predict mosquito larvae abundance in West Africa. Our models leverage environmental data to develop accurate predictions of mosquito larvae counts. We performed a comparative analysis of two machine learning models to evaluate which model is best suited for predicting mosquito habitats. Our work  provides valuable insights for future research and the development of early warning systems for mosquito-borne disease prevention.
